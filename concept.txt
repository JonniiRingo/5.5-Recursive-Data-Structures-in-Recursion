Lesson 5.5: Recursive Data Structures in Recursion

Concept Overview:
In this lesson, we will explore how recursion is used to define and work with recursive data structures. 
Recursive data structures are data structures that can be defined in terms of similar structures of smaller instances of themselves. 
Understanding and manipulating these structures is a fundamental part of computer science and programming.
